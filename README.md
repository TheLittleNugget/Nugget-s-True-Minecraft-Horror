Here is a fully Vr or NONVR compatible Minecraft Horror Modpack. This modpack I mainly made to play with VR and to scare the shit out of myself.

- Horror Modpack
- Multiplayer without Server (essential mod)
- VR or NONVR Compatible
- Gets Updates

Multiplayer
The ESSENTIAL MOD mod is a mod basically turning java into bedrock... for the multiplayer side of things I guess. There is a wardrobe where you can buy different clothing items and cosmetics. This mod has a friending system too, just start a singleplayer world and open up your menu, on the right side click invite or whatever and then start the world in multiplayer and invite your friends.

VR
I am making sure that this modpack is fully compatible in VR.. ok maybe not fully but I want it too at least work and play the whole main part of the game just fine. When you start the modpack you will se a toggle called "VR". If you put your VR on, connect to SteamVR and then click the VR toggle then you will be in VR.

NONVR
You can play it just fine without a VR... if anything probably better.

Best Mod for VR is like.. immersive MC which makes it WONDERFUL... it doesn't work on this version ðŸ˜­

Performance Guide of Mine I guess
